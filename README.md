# A8X-moment
This is nothing more than a place that holds tools/software for jailbreaking/modding the iPad Air 2

As of now none of the code in this repo is mine, none is claimed by me, all the developers will me mentioned in this document (if anything in this catagory needs updated or there is a licencing issue, feel free to contact me and ill change it as soon a i get the chance)

Most (if not all) of the code in this repo is not specific for A8X, if it is, it likely will have a alternative for other chips

First things first, if you’re getting into the deeper level stuff in apple products in general, invest in a Mac, trust me it will help. Also, if anything happens to your device, it is only your fault. Nobody but you is responsible for your actions



First thing ill mention is for getting into pwndfu mode, normal Ipwndfu from axi0mX will not get you into pwndfu mode for A8X, so you have to use the Eclipsa7001 (originally from 0x7ff but the file provided was fixed and compiled by Cryptiiiic) to get into pwndfu. 

Next is all the other binaries you might (or might not) need, I recommend getting:
Kernel64Patcher (Ralph0045)
iBoot64Patcher (tihmstar)
img4 (xerub)
img4tool (tihmstar)
irecovery (libimobiledevice)
ldid (xerub) source-https://github.com/xerub/ldid
tsschecker (tihmstar)
(All these files go into /usr/local/bin and can be moved with the mv command ‘sudo mv /path/to/file /usr/local/bin’)

Just to note, for certain tools you might need other peoples forks of these tools to get them to work, in that case credit goes to those developers to

there is probably more that i haven’t mentioned but this should be good to get you started all the files will be under /binaries in this repo

For futurerestore, just use it normally, there’s nothing special that you have to do for A8X compared to other chips

In 99% cases, treat A8X as A9 rather than A8, I’m sure there are cases that that is wrong but unless it says otherwise, treat it as A9 for most cases as of now (while its still getting updates)

That’s about it for this repo, just a place for the Air 2 tools, if anything needs added or changed contact me @ iliketwertles#3859 on discord, thats the best way to get ahold of me
